Machine Learning With Python For Dummies:tm:

In a nutshell, this was my IB Personal Project for Year 11, where I used Python to create a neural network that could recognise Lego brick models despite differing positions and colours. It was pain then, and it's still pain today, but at least now I have it set in stone that I did something noteworthy with my life.

Hot tip: you need to put the code in blenderender.txt into Blender's 'scripting' tab for this whole thing to work. Just a heads up.
